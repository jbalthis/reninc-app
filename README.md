# RenRPG, Inc. Code Review

A simple SPA to make a call to the RenRPG, Inc. API and search the donor list available there.

## Running the app

In the 'api' directory first, and then, in the 'client' directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### IMPORTANT

The API key is not correct and this is causing the app to return an error code from the API call. This as well as building the donor listing still need to be completed as well as some general tidying up.

### Powered By

This app was built using Node, Express, React, and Grommet.
